# Ismail Mechbal

I am a web developer based in Stockholm. I currently run [WeRunik](https://www.werunik.com/), a company buildling software applications with a focus on UX, KISS & Elegant code.

##Web development

I got introduced to programming while in elementary school, basic was my first programming language, a short while after I started designing web sites, i reckon my first website was dedicated to IAM.
